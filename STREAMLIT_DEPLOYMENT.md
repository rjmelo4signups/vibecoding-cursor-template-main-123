# Streamlit Cloud Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy your expenses app to Streamlit Cloud with Google Sheets integration.

## Step 1: Prepare Your GitHub Repository

### 1.1 Push Your Code to GitHub
1. Make sure all your files are committed and pushed to your GitHub repository
2. Your repository should include:
   - `expenses_list.py` (main app)
   - `google_sheets_helper.py` (Google Sheets integration)
   - `requirements.txt` (dependencies)
   - `GOOGLE_SHEETS_SETUP.md` (setup instructions)

### 1.2 Repository Structure
Your repository should look like this:
```
your-repo/
├── expenses_list.py
├── google_sheets_helper.py
├── requirements.txt
├── GOOGLE_SHEETS_SETUP.md
└── .gitignore
```

## Step 2: Deploy to Streamlit Cloud

### 2.1 Go to Streamlit Cloud
1. Visit [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
2. Sign in with your GitHub account
3. Click "New app"

### 2.2 Configure Your App
1. **Repository**: Select your GitHub repository
2. **Branch**: Choose `main` (or your default branch)
3. **Main file path**: Enter `expenses_list.py`
4. **App URL**: Choose a custom URL (e.g., `your-name-expenses-app`)

### 2.3 Set Up Secrets in Streamlit Cloud
1. In your Streamlit Cloud dashboard, go to your app
2. Click "Settings" (gear icon)
3. Go to "Secrets" tab
4. Add your Google Sheet ID:

```toml
GOOGLE_SHEET_ID = "your-actual-spreadsheet-id-here"
```

## Step 3: Configure Google Sheets for Cloud Deployment

### 3.1 Update Google Cloud Console
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Select your project
3. Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
4. Edit your OAuth client
5. **Add authorized redirect URIs**:
   - `https://your-app-name.streamlit.app/`
   - `https://your-app-name.streamlit.app/_stcore/oauth/callback`

### 3.2 Download New Credentials
1. Download the updated `credentials.json`
2. **Important**: You need to upload this to Streamlit Cloud

## Step 4: Upload Credentials to Streamlit Cloud

### 4.1 Create a Secrets File
Create a file called `.streamlit/secrets.toml` in your repository:

```toml
GOOGLE_SHEET_ID = "your-actual-spreadsheet-id-here"

# Google Sheets API Credentials (base64 encoded)
GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS = """
# Paste your credentials.json content here (base64 encoded)
# You'll need to encode your credentials.json file
"""
```

### 4.2 Encode Your Credentials
Run this command to encode your credentials:

```bash
# On Mac/Linux
base64 -i credentials.json

# On Windows (PowerShell)
[Convert]::ToBase64String([IO.File]::ReadAllBytes("credentials.json"))
```

### 4.3 Generate Tokens for Cloud Deployment

**IMPORTANT**: Streamlit Cloud doesn't have a browser, so we need to generate tokens locally first.

1. **Run the token generator** (locally on your computer):
```bash
python generate_cloud_tokens.py
```

2. **Follow the authentication flow** in your browser when prompted

3. **Copy the generated tokens** to your Streamlit Cloud secrets

### 4.4 Update Your Streamlit Secrets

Add these to your Streamlit Cloud secrets (in the Streamlit Cloud dashboard):

```toml
GOOGLE_SHEET_ID = "your-actual-spreadsheet-id-here"

# Generated by generate_cloud_tokens.py
GOOGLE_TOKENS = "your-generated-tokens-here"
GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS = "your-generated-credentials-here"
```

## Step 5: Deploy and Test

### 5.1 Deploy Your App
1. Push all changes to your GitHub repository
2. Streamlit Cloud will automatically redeploy your app
3. Check the deployment logs for any errors

### 5.2 Test Your App
1. Visit your deployed app URL
2. Try adding a new expense
3. Check your Google Sheet to verify data is being saved
4. Refresh the app to see if it loads existing data

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **"Credentials not found"**: Make sure you've uploaded credentials to Streamlit secrets
2. **"Permission denied"**: Check that your Google Sheet is shared with the correct account
3. **"Invalid redirect URI"**: Update your Google Cloud Console with the correct Streamlit URL
4. **"App won't load"**: Check the deployment logs in Streamlit Cloud

### Getting Help:
- Check Streamlit Cloud logs in your app dashboard
- Verify your Google Cloud Console settings
- Test locally first to ensure everything works

## Security Notes

- Never commit `credentials.json` or `token.pickle` to your repository
- Use Streamlit secrets for sensitive configuration
- Regularly rotate your Google API credentials
- Monitor your Google Cloud Console for unusual activity

## Cost Information

- **Streamlit Cloud**: Free for public repositories
- **Google Sheets API**: Free for reasonable usage
- **Google Cloud**: Free tier available

Your app will be accessible at: `https://your-app-name.streamlit.app`
